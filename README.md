# Mwalimu-Central - Organisation at its peak!!
End of Course Project Details

Project Description
The Mwalimu Central project is designed to allow teachers teaching the Competence Based Curriculum to genetate their professional documents with ease. Currently, majority have to handwrite their work and this is time consuming and cumbersome. The professional documents include schemes of work, lesson plans, assessment rubrics and records of work. Other records incude student assessement reports, Individualised Educational Plans (IEP) for learners with special needs. In this demo, I have included a self-evaluation form as personal appraisals are critial in growth and striving towards excellence. This is a longer-term project and this part is the demo stage. 

How the system runs
To help generate the documents, a database was build using MySQL. The database holds the Curriculum Designs which are provided to the teachers by the Government of Kenya via the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development. The guidelines are then input into the documents listed above and the teacher also has their input and this is a way of expressing their creativity. To access the information, the teachers will use the website. Currently, the documents have been done per strand and saved in a zipped folder that the teachers can download. This process will allow the teacher to spend more time planning and researching for the lessons, the time they would have spent copying the detials from the designs. I believe that this will enrich our teaching and learning. 

Programs used
As mentioned, SQL carries the database. This is a long term project that has the ability to attract a huge user population. To this end, it was necessary to start off with database that has the capacity to accommodate the projected growth. The front end has been done mainly using HTML and CSS and a little bit of JavaScript and PHP. These programs are versitile and fogriving to beginners. 

Installation Process
The system is currently a webpage that can run on any browsers. 

Challenges
My main challenge was that being a beginner, making decisions takes time. This was both positive and negative as I also managed to learn a lot during this season. Because of that too, some of what I wanted to implement became a challenge for example, I would have wished I could figure out how teachers can access the MySQL database from the web, create and run their queries and generate the desired reports. That link has still not come to me however, I was able to download the information on Microsoft Excel, and use that to merge with Microsoft Word templates to create the documents in Word which the teachers will now be able to download and customise. 

Another challenge was my underestimating the time I woud need. Initially I had planned to complete input of the curriculum designs for the Pre-Primary Level however, I only managed four learning areas in PP1. The finish point is ensuring that all the curriculum designs from PP1 to the current grade being 7 all entered and reports generated. 

Features to implement
1. A way in which users can access the database directly, make their queries and download the reports in formats they can later manipulate. 
2. An avenue for teachers/users can store their work and incuding resource materials and also be able to share with others. This may also include a communiation and collaboration platform where users can interact. 
3. Modules where teachers can store student records and use that to help generate the periodic reports as needed. 
4. As we continue to interact as teachers and interested users, other ideas will definitely come up and implement them.

Credits
1. First I would like to credit all the lecturers and staff of PLP. This would definitely not have been possible without each of you! Please receive my gratitude!
2. I visited so many sites and unfortunately kept very poor records! Yes! There is a huge community out there and I have subscribed to a number of them and yes, the journey continues. 
3. I would like to credit my son. Apart from designing the logo (managed to put it out as a favicon), he supported me with many ideas including the slogan. Thank you young man!
4. I managed to also work well with a good number of PLP students, most I only know by name and I thank God for that! Their youth has given me a fresh approach and I will forever be grateful to them.
5. Many others I can credit but I will end here by crediting He who is my Father and Saviour, our Lord and God!
